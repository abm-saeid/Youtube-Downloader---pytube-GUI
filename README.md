# Youtube Downloader - pytube GUI

GUI for the pytube module using tkinter. Useful for downloading YouTube audio and video. Includes batch processing option.

This is a simple graphical user interface for the pytube module using tkinter.
While pytube is very powerful, this GUI makes use of only a few functions to make it simple for users.
There are 2 import options; link or txt file containing links.
If you are using a txt file with links for batch processing, there must be a separate link on each new line and no blank lines in the file.
The download options are for audio only, best progressive (video with audio) which is 720p, and best video.
All files will be downloaded as mp4.
There is also an option to select the download folder.

The progress indicator shows the user when the program is working to get the stream information, which file it is up to, and the progress on that file.

I hope you enjoy using this GUI.
